# Q.1 Difference b/w http and https.
Ans :-
    .Http  :- stands for hypertext transfer protocol
    .https :- stands for hypertext transfer protocol plus 'S' stands for security
              .Https is more secure than http,because they use ssl and tls certificate
              .based with configuration of ssl and tls certificate in https , it makes an insecure n/w more secure.so that https is preferable more than http

# Q.2 We have ssl incoming connection where do you terminate it in terms of your cloud boundary.
